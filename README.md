# Galaga Game on FPGA
Term Project for SKKU Logic Design Lab ICE2005 (Galaga style game)


A simplified **Galaga-style shooting game** designed and implemented using **Verilog HDL** on an **FPGA development board**.

## üì∫ Display

- The game **must display on a monitor via a VGA connection**.

## üéÆ Input & Interaction

- Uses **FPGA hardware** (e.g., push buttons or DIP switches) to receive input from the **user**.

---

## ‚úÖ Term Project Requirements (Mandatory)

- Player can move horizontally (controlled by push buttons or DIP switches).
- Player can fire bullets.
- Enemies appear and move (simple downward or patterned movement).
- Bullets can hit and eliminate enemies.
- One player, one type of enemy, and a single bullet instance.

---

## ‚≠ê Bonus Credits (Optional)

- Graphic Quality
- Player can move vertically or diagonally
- Two or multi player mode
- Multiple enemy/bullet types or movement patterns
- Score display (using 7-segment LEDs or VGA text rendering)
- Multiple game stages or boss enemies
- Basic sound effects (using buzzer)
